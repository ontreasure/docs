During the create event process you are able to set the type of applications and checkout type for your vendors. See the image below for accessing this setting.

By default, your event will have Standard Applications and Standard Checkout. All 3 checkout types can be used with either application type. To learn more about the different application and checkout types, read on.

Before changing your application or checkout type, all pending applications require a response (approval or denial). This ensures a smooth experience for both vendors and organizers.

## Application Types

### Standard Applications (default)

The standard vendor application requires vendors to input basic information about their contact method, inventory, and business. They can optionally provide a table preference that you can use to inform assignment later on. Vendors will also have to accept the terms & conditions that you set.

### Table Select

Using Table Select allows vendors to select their own table during the application process. This requires a complete [venue map](/essentials/mapping), and, as a result, is only available for organizers that are subscribed to the Starter or Pro plan. In this application method, vendors are still required to input basic information about their contact method, inventory, and business. Vendors will also still have to accept the terms & conditions that you set.

## Checkout Types

### Standard Checkout (default)

The standard vendor checkout only requires a vendor to input payment information after they've  been approved. Once you as the organizer approve a vendors, application, they will receive an email and a text message with a secure checkout link that directs them to pay for the tables they have been approved for.

### AutoPay

AutoPay is a feature that allows event organizers to modify their vendor application process so the payment charge is initiated upon acceptance of a vendor application. Vendors save their preferred payment method during the application process and are only charged if accepted.  See the [full guide](/essentials/auto-pay) on AutoPay for more information

### Instant Checkout

Instant checkout eliminates the vendor approval process and requires payment at the time of application. Immediately after a vendor completes their application, they are directed to the checkout screen to secure their table. If they do not checkout within 20 minutes of proceeding to the checkout page, their spot is released. In cases where Table Select is enabled, this will make the table available for purchase again.
