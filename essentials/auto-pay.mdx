description: "Enable AutoPay to charge vendors upon application acceptance and cut down on back and forth communication about payment timelines"
---

AutoPay is a feature that allows event organizers to modify their vendor application process so the payment charge is initiated upon acceptance of a vendor application. Vendors save their preferred payment method during the application process and are only charged if accepted.&#x20;

<Note>
  Vendors who save a payment method that does not have sufficient funds will lose their table reservation at the event they applied for.
</Note>

To turn on AutoPay for one of your events, you can submit a request through the [support form](https://app.formbricks.com/s/cls9piboz4960sted3d1snwj2). A member from the Treasure team will reach out with next steps!

## What your vendors will see

With AutoPay enabled, vendors' application process is the same until the Payment Method screen "pictured below." Here, vendors are given the option to set a card or connect their bank to process the charge if their application is accepted.![](/images/set-method.png)

### Card

For vendors that choose to submit with their card information, the card will automatically be charged when the vendor is accepted by the event organizer. ![](/images/set-method-card.png)

### Bank

For vendors that choose to connect their bank to pay, the bank charge will be initiated when the application is accepted, but the transaction will take 3-5 business days to clear.&#x20;

While the bank transaction is processing, the vendor's application within the event's vendor dashboard will display the "Payment Processing" status message. This is to be expected for any vendor using bank while AutoPay is enabled. Vendors that pay with card will not have this status, as their card is charged immediately.![](/images/payment_processing.png)

<Info>
  Note that with AutoPay, changes to prices of your tables after a vendor application is submitted will not impact the amount that vendor pays with AutoPay. Vendors will be charged the price that you had for your tables at the time of their application, regardless of any changes to the price made after they applied.
