For organizers that would like to provide discounts for customers purchasing more than one item, we offer tiered pricing. This allows you to change the price of items depending on how many of that item your customer is purchasing.

### Create your items & tiers

  </Step>
  <Step title="Build your tier and save the item">
    Use the tiered pricing feature to create different prices for different quantities of items purchased. Here, you set the range of how many items at minimum and maximum a customer can buy in order to receive the tiered price. The upper bound on the range for the tier with the largest quantities included will automatically become the maximum number of that type of item your customers can purchase. Be sure to save your changes after creating the tier.
