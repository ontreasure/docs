  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Your Add-on">
    You are able to set whether your add-on should be available to attendees, vendors, or both, as well as its name and description. 

    You can also take advantage of [tiered pricing](/essentials/tiered-pricing) here to offer discounts for bulk purchases of add-ons. Once you set all fields as desired, save the add-on and your event.
