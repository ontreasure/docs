Treasure allows you to build a team of your event staff to make managing your event easier for everyone involved. From your event dashboard, you can navigate to the "Manage Team" page in the lefthand menu to get started.

## Event Roles

From this page, you can add team members as one of 4 roles, outlined below.

1. Host

   * Hosts that you have all of the same permissions as the event creator (you) and will be able to add/remove members of the team as such

2. Co-Host

   * Co-Hosts have all permissions of a host except for deleting an event. They will also appear on your event page

3. Staff

   * Staff can manage your event's vendors, ticket sales, and other analytics, but they will not show up on the event page

4. Scanner

   * Scanners are only able to scan tickets and check-in vendors. They will not see event stats, like your total revenue, from the mobile app view

<Tip>
  Every role is able to scan tickets and check-in vendors using the [Treasure Events mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/treasure-events/id6670620747).
