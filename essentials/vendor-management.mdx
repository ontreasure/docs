## Manage Vendors

To manage your vendors on Treasure, there are a few key steps that will help to make the process go smoothly from day 1.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Your Table and Application Information">
    When creating or editing your event, you can set:&#x20;

    * The price and size of your tables

    * Vendor check-in information

    * Custom vendor application questions

  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Vendors on Your Vendors Page">
    Once your event is live and you start receiving vendor applications, you can keep track of them from the Vendors page (accessible by clicking "View Vendors" from your host dashboard". This page provides an overview of the number of applications you've accepted/rejected and how much of each table tier you've sold. It also shows you a filterable table of all your vendor applications regardless of their status.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Vendor Applications">
    If you click into any vendor application, you will see all of their responses to the default vendor application questions, as well as any unique questions that you added in the create event process. You can add notes to vendors and accept, reject, or waitlist them from their application

### Vendor Payment

You're able to accept vendor payment in three different timelines:

1. Accept payment immediately and accept vendors without review

2. Auto-pay: Charge vendors when you accept their application (they will be prompted to add payment information during the application process)

3. Allow vendors to pay in a set window after being accepted (this gives your vendors the most flexibility to pay when it is convenient for them)

<Tip>
  Note that with option 2, changes to prices of your tables after a vendor application will not impact the amount they pay. Vendors will receive the price that you had for your tables at the time of their application, regardless of any changes to the price made after they applied.



  (i.e. You create your event with auto-pay enabled and set your table price at $100. Two vendors apply when you open your registration. After their application comes in, you change the table price to $120. The 2 vendors that applied already will pay $100 per table.)
</Tip>

### Temporary Vendors and "Mark as Paid"

For your vendors that don't want to use Treasure at all, we offer a solution in the form of temporary vendors.&#x20;

* Temporary vendors are created by you, and can be treated like any other vendor once they are set up in your event

  * They can be assigned to specific tables on your venue map

  * You can designate the exact type of tables they purchased

  * They **will not** be able to update their own information such as additional social links&#x20;

Vendors that are comfortable applying with their information on Treasure but have arranged for an alternative form of payment with you can be "Mark as Paid" from the vendor dashboard once they are accepted.&#x20;

* Vendors that are mark as paid (and temporary vendors) will not impact your total sales numbers on Treasure at all
