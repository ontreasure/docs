Treasure allows organizers to build interactive venue maps where they can highlight vendors, special guests and other exciting event features!

Hosts have the option to build venue map templates that can be reused across events or build one-time layouts for specific events.

## Venue Map Templates

To get started with creating a venue map template you can navigate to the ["Venue Maps" page](https://www.ontreasure.com/host/venue-maps) from your host dashboard.

## Building Your Venue Map

After you decide whether you want to build a template or an event-specific map, you can get started on building your first venue map! Below are the steps for creating and going live on your event page with a venue map:

<Note>
  If you are building a venue map template, you will need to navigate into a specific event after creating the template to set the template as the venue map for that event. You can do this by navigating to the desired event's dashboard and selecting your new template from the "Edit Venue Map" page on the lefthand menu of the dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import Your Floorplan">
    Select the image icon in the right hand toolbar to import an accurate image of your floor plan that you will layout your vendor tables within&#x20;

  </Step>

  <Step title="Place Vendor Tables">
    When your floor plan is set, you can begin placing your vendor tables! To do so, click the shapes icon on the right hand toolbar. Then, select a pre-made shape or create a new one of your own and use the bottom toolbar to toggle between placing rows and single tables, as well as setting the color of your shape.

  <Step title="Place Event Amenities">
    You can add event amenities, like restrooms and dining areas from the bookshelf icon on the same right hand toolbar.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Vendors">
    Once you finish setting up your table and other event landmarks, you can begin to assign your vendors to tables. Clicking into "Vendor Assignments" in the top left corner of your map will expand the vendor assignment menu that includes a list of every accepted vendor as well as the tables they requested in their application. From this list, you are able to click into any vendor and assign them to tables on your newly created map. Information from a vendor's application and the table types they booked will automatically appear here.

  <Step title="Update Your Settings">
    When your map is completely built and you want to share it with your vendors or make it public on your event page, you can follow these steps:

    1. Save your map and click the Settings Icon in the top right of your map

    2. In your settings panel, switch to the "Map Display" tab. There, you can toggle map visibility on, and select whether everyone or just your vendors can see the map

    3. Set a border for your map that encompasses the entire venue map you've created (*it is recommended to include additional padding in the border around your floor plan for better visibility on your event page*).

    4. Check out a preview of what your venue map will look like when it's live on your page

    5. Save your settings!
