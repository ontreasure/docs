On Treasure, organizers have the ability to pass on processing fees to their customers (this is the default setting) or absorb them for both ticket and table sales. For more information on the fees associated with each transaction you can see our [Pricing](https://www.ontreasure.com/pricing) and determine which plan best fits your management needs. You can also add custom fees like Sales Tax or your own service fee to your event (instructions are at the bottom of this document).

To set whether you pass on or absorb fees, you can toggle the "Absorb Fees" switch in your create event below (see images below for context). This can be switched at any time through the duration of your event's sales. To access the settings for tickets or tables, click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the section in the create or edit event process.

For more information on passing on fees vs. absorbing them and examples of customer checkout in both scenarios, read on.

## Pass on fees (default)

By default, the processing fees for each transaction associated with your events will be passed on to your customer. This means that you will receive the price you list your items at each time a sale is completed. This functions the same for tickets and tables.

<Info>
  In the example below, the organizer listed their ticket price at \$10. There was a processing fee of \$1.53 associated with the order, and they maintain the default setting of passing on fees to their customer. As a result, their payout from this order would be \$10 while the customer pays \$11.53.

## Absorb fees

If you elect to absorb fees for either tickets or tables, your customer will not see any processing fee on their order during checkout. All the fees will be deducted from your final payout.

<Info>
  In the example below, the organizer listed their ticket price at \$80. Because this organizer elected to absorb the processing fees for their customer, the customer pays exactly \$80. All the fees will be deducted from the organizers payout on the backend.

  </Step>

  </Step>
  <Step title="New Step">
    When creating a new fee, you are able to set the name that will appear on your customers' checkout, the amount (in \$ or %) of the fee, and the visibility (is this fee only for attendees, vendors, or for both groups of customers?). After all of those are set as desired, you can save the fee and save the changes to your event to complete the process.
