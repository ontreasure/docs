<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Events">
    Click the "Events" page on the lefthand menu of your host dashboard

## Event Dashboard

The above steps will take you to your event dashboard for one of your events. This is the hub that displays all your event's performance metrics, actions you can take to promote your event, the ability to manage your team, and the venue map editor.

### Sales

To view your event's sales, you can click on the "View Orders" button in the above dashboard. The sales page shows all the purchases (tickets and tables) that have been made as well as the payout associated with each order. If your customer used a promo code, it will also show up on this page. To learn more about how to create promo codes, you can check out the [promo code guide](/essentials/promo-codes).

As sales come in, they will be paid out to the payout method you set in your Payouts page. The dollar amount that appears on each record in the Sales page is the amount you will receive from Treasure after service and transaction fees are collected. For information on the schedule of payouts, check out our [pricing page](https://www.ontreasure.com/pricing). For more information on payouts, you can read the [payouts guide](/essentials/payouts).

### Attendees

The attendees page shows all the unique ticket purchasers for your event. Clicking into any attendee will show you all the tickets they hold, the attendee's contact info, and whether their tickets have been scanned.<img src="/images/attendees.png" alt="" />

### Vendors

The vendors page provides an overview of the number of applications you've accepted/rejected and how much of each table tier you've sold. It also shows you a filterable table of all your vendor applications regardless of their status. To learn more about vendor management, you can see the [full guide](/essentials/vendor-management).
