## Event Dashboard

The above steps will take you to your event dashboard for one of your events. This is the hub that displays all your event's performance metrics, actions you can take to promote your event, the ability to manage your team, and the venue map editor.

### Sales

The sales page shows all the purchases (tickets and tables) that have been made as well as the payout associated with each order. If your customer used a promo code, it will also show up on this page. To learn more about how to create promo codes, you can check out the *promo code guide* (coming soon).![](/images/sales.png)

As sales come in, they will be reflected in your payouts page. For information on the schedule of payouts, you can check out our [pricing page](https://www.ontreasure.com/pricing). For more information on payouts, you can read the *payouts guide* (coming soon).
