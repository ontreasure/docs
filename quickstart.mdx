### Create and track

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create your event" icon="image">
    To create your first event on Treasure, you can navigate to the [Create Event page](https://www.ontreasure.com/create). Here, all the necessary information to get your event up and running is laid out in the order it will appear on in your live event page. Here are some things to keep in mind as your going through the creation process:&#x20;

    1. While not required, a poster is a great way to establish your brand on Treasure and maintain the community you've built around your event

    2. You can edit information for your event at any time, and you can always revisit the edit event page to update things like enabling sales, additional ticket/table tiers, and the special guests you have

    3. If you have multiple events with the same basic information, you can duplicate events from your [host dashboard](https://www.ontreasure.com/host/events) to easily list numerous events in a short time

    4. If you enable sales on Treasure, be sure to set your payout information, which can be accessed by clicking into any event fro	m your [events page](https://www.ontreasure.com/host/events)

       1. For more information about payout timing, you can reference our [pricing page](https://www.ontreasure.com/pricing)

    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally.

    1. Install the
       [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
       documentation changes locally with this command: `npm i -g mintlify`

    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
       `docs.json` is): `mintlify dev`

    <Note>
      If youâ€™re currently using the legacy `mint.json` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:

      `npm i -g mintlify@latest`
      And run the new upgrade command in your docs repository:

      `mintlify upgrade`
      You should now be using the new `docs.json` configuration file. Feel free to delete the `mint.json` file from your repository.
