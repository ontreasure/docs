### Create and track

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create your event" icon="image">
    To create your first event on Treasure, you can navigate to the [create event page](https://www.ontreasure.com/create). Here, all the necessary information to get your event up and running is laid out in the order it will appear on in your live event page. Here are some things to keep in mind as your going through the creation process:&#x20;

    1. While not required, a poster is a great way to establish your brand on Treasure and maintain the community you've built around your event

    2. You can edit information for your event at any time, and you can always revisit the edit event page to update things like enabling sales, additional ticket/table tiers, and the special guests you have

    3. If you have multiple events with the same basic information, you can duplicate events from your [host dashboard](https://www.ontreasure.com/host/events) to easily list numerous events in a short time

    4. If you enable sales on Treasure, be sure to set your payout information, which can be accessed by clicking into any event from your [events page](https://www.ontreasure.com/host/events)

       1. For more information about payout timing, you can reference our [pricing page](https://www.ontreasure.com/pricing)

  <Accordion title="Track vendor applications" icon="store">
    Treasure makes tracking vendor applications payments centralized and seamless. When creating an event, you are prompted to add information for vendors, event-specific questions you want them to answer, and terms & conditions for vending at your event.&#x20;

    Once your event is live, you can easily manage your vendors with our built-in tools:

    * You can see a snapshot of pending vendor applications, and click into any of your upcoming events to get more information from the [host dashboard](https://www.ontreasure.com/host)

    * To provide a visual representation of vendors' table assignments to them and your attendees, build your interactive venue map that can be displayed on your event page or just to your vendors. See our [guide on mapping](/essentials/mapping) for more information.

    You're able to accept vendor payment in three different timelines:

    1. Accept payment immediately and accept vendors without review

    2. Charge vendors when you accept their application (they will be prompted to add payment information during the application process)

    3. Allow vendors to pay in a set window after being accepted (this gives your vendors the most flexibility to pay when it is convenient for them)

    <Note>
      Note that with option 2, vendors will receive the price that you had for your tables at the time of their application, regardless of any changes to the price made after they applied
